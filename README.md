##Run app
###To get application running locally you will need to create a configuration file (location /config/config.js). There is an example file already at that location (configExample.js). You can simply rename that file to config.js or duplicate and rename it. A valid connection string for a mongodb instance is required.

##Deployment
###install.sh and restartAndUpdate.sh are meant to be used in a deployment environment (not locally). If you run them, please confirm (by checking) that you want those commands to execute.
